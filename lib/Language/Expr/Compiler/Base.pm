=head1 NAME

Language::Expr::Compiler::Base - Base class for Expr compilers

=head1 VERSION

This document describes version 0.22 of module Language::Expr::Compiler::Base (in distribution Language-Expr), released on 2014-04-28.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES (MANUAL)

=head2 markers => ARRAYREF

Used to mark compile output string with various unique strings, and
later on revisit these markers and substitute for other, final
values. This technique is kind of a hack, used for subexpression,
inserting PHP use() statement (because they must be processed outward
to inward), etc.

=head2 func_mapping => HASHREF

Map Expr function to target language's function/method/property.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 hook_var

Can be set to a coderef that will be called during parsing whenever variable is
encountered. The coderef is called with variable name as argument, and expected
to return target language code to handle the variable. By default, if this
attribute is not set, variable in expression is returned as is (e.g. '$foo'
becomes '$foo' in Perl), which means some will result in error (e.g. '${name
that contains some symbols that makes it invalid Perl}').

If the coderef returns undef, the default behaviour is used.

Note that due to current limitation of Perl regex and/or Regexp::Grammars, you
cannot use any regex in your hook_var.

=head2 hook_func

Can be set to a coderef that will be called during parsing whenever a function
call is encountered. The coderef is called as its arguments function name and
list of arguments and expected to return target language code to handle the
function call. By default, if this attribute is not set, variable in expression
is returned as is (e.g. 'foo(1, 2, 3)' becomes 'foo(1, 2, 3)' in Perl).

If the coderef returns undef, the default behaviour is used.

Note that due to current limitation of Perl regex and/or Regexp::Grammars, you
cannot use any regex in your hook_var.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new_marker(TYPE[, DATA]) => UUID

Create a new marker. Return a unique ID to be placed in compiled
output.

=head2 marker_ids() => ARRAY

Return an array of all marker IDs.

=head2 marker_ids_re() => STRING

Return a regex that matches marker IDs.
